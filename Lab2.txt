Student Management System: Introduction to C# Object-Oriented Programming
In this assignment, you will create a simple student management system using C#. You will define a custom class called Student to represent students and implement basic functionalities to add, view, and update student records.

Task:

Define the Student Class:
Create a C# class named Student.
Add properties to the class: Name (string type), Age (integer type), and Grade (string type).
Implement a constructor in the Student class to initialize these properties.
Input Handling:
Use the Console.ReadLine() method to prompt the user to enter the student's name, age, and grade.
Convert the user input for age to an integer using Convert.ToInt32() method.
Create an Instance of the Student Class:
Instantiate the Student class using the input provided by the user for name, age, and grade.
Print Output:
Print out the values of the Name, Age, and Grade properties of the created Student instance to the console.
Instructions:

Write the C# code for the Student class and the Main method as described above.
Ensure that the input prompts are clear and informative to guide the user.
Test your program by running it and providing different inputs to verify its functionality.
Document your code with appropriate comments to explain its purpose and functionality.
Submission:

Submit the C# code file (.cs) containing the implementation of the Student class and the Main method.
Include any additional instructions or notes if necessary.


Your answer

using System;

class Student
{
    // Define properties
    // Complete Step 1:............

    // Define constructor
    // Complete Step 2:............
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Prompt the user to enter student details
        string name;
        Console.WriteLine("Enter student's name:");
        name=Console.ReadLine();
        // Complete Step 3:............
        int age;
        Console.WriteLine("Enter student's age:");
        age=Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        // Complete Step 4:............
        string grade;
        Console.WriteLine("Enter student's grade:");
        grade=Console.ReadLine();
        // Complete Step 5:............

        // Create an instance of the Student class
        // Complete Step 6:............

        // Print student details
        // Complete Step 7:............
        Console.WriteLine("Student Name: "+name);
        Console.WriteLine("Student Age: "+age);
        Console.WriteLine("Student Grade: "+grade);

Question 2
Marks: 1/1

Library Management System: Introduction to C# Object-Oriented Programming( Without Collection)
In this assignment, you will create a simple library management system using C#. You will define a custom class called Book to represent books and implement basic functionalities to add and view book records.

Task:

Define the Book Class:
Create a C# class named Book.
Add properties to the class: Title (string type), Author (string type), and Year (integer type).
Implement a constructor in the Book class to initialize these properties.
Input Handling:
Use the Console.ReadLine() method to prompt the user to enter the book's title, author, and year.
Convert the user input for year to an integer using Convert.ToInt32() method.
Create an Instance of the Book Class:
Instantiate the Book class using the input provided by the user for title, author, and year.
Print Output:
Print out the values of the Title, Author, and Year properties of the created Book instance to the console.
Instructions:

Write the C# code for the Book class and the Main method as described above.
Ensure that the input prompts are clear and informative to guide the user.
Test your program by running it and providing different inputs to verify its functionality.
Document your code with appropriate comments to explain its purpose and functionality.
Submission:

Submit the C# code file (.cs) containing the implementation of the Book class and the Main method.
Include any additional instructions or notes if necessary.


Your answer

using System;

class Book
{
    // Define properties
    // Complete Step 1:............

    // Define constructor
    // Complete Step 2:............
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Prompt the user to enter book details
        string title;
        Console.WriteLine("Enter book's title:");
        title=Console.ReadLine();
        // Complete Step 3:............
        string author;
        Console.WriteLine("Enter book's author:");
        author=Console.ReadLine();
        // Complete Step 4:............

        int year;
        Console.WriteLine("Enter book's year:");
        year=Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        
        // Complete Step 5:............

        // Create an instance of the Book class
        // Complete Step 6:............
        Console.WriteLine("Book Title: "+title);
        Console.WriteLine("Book Author: "+author);
        Console.WriteLine("Book Year: "+year);

        // Print book details
        // Complete Step 7:............
